    <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of some of Grace Hooper's achievements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1906</strong> - Grace is born in New York City</li>
      <li><strong>1913</strong> - At the young age of 7, Grace began to take apart family alarm clocks in order to tryn and figure out how they worked.</li>
      <li><strong>1928</strong> - Grace graduate Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics.</li>
      <li><strong>1930</strong> - Grace eaned her Master's degree from Yale.</li>
      <li><strong>1931</strong> - She began teaching Mathematics at Vassar.</li>
      <li><strong>1934</strong> - Grace earned her Ph.D in Mathematics from Yale.</li>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - Vassar College promotes her to associate professor.</li>
      <li><strong>1943</strong> - After initialy being rejected due to her position, Grace took a leave of absence from Vassar in order to join the Navy during WWII.</li>
      <li><strong>1944</strong> - Grace graduated top of her class from Naval Reserve Midshipmen's school at Smith College and assigned to the  Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade.</li>
      <li><strong>1947</strong> - While working on the Mark II computer at Harvard, Grace and her associates discovered and had to litteraly debug a moth that was impeding the operation of the relay.</li>
      <li><strong>1949</strong> - Grace became senior mathemetician at Ecker-Mauchly Computer Corporation and served as director of Aytomatic Programing Development for UNIVAC which was the first large-scale electronic computer on the market in 1950.<br>
        During this time, Grace brought up the idea of using English to create code instead of numbers and symbols. She was told it wouldn't work because computers dont understand English.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - Grace created an operational link-loader. Origionally others rejected it claiming that computers could only do arithmetic.</li>
      <li><strong>1954</strong> - Grace was named the company's first director of automatic programing and released some of the first compiler based programing languages such as MATH-MATIC and FLOW=MATIC.</li>
      <li><strong>1959</strong> - She served as a technical consultant to the commitee which developed the new coding language COBOL which is still used today.</li>
      <li><strong>1970s</strong> - Grace advocated for the Defense Department to replace its old, large centrilized systems with networks of small, distributed computers.</li>
      <li><strong>1983</strong> - Grace was promoted to the rank of Commodore, which was later renamed to rear admiral.</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> After serving since WWII, Grace retired from the Navy.</li>

    </ul>

      <p>"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that. "I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.""</p>
